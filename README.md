# Kodi.Screensaver.TurnOffLGTV
Kodi (xbmc) screensaver that turns off your LG TV via Ethernet.  

Poor fix of the LG TV 2015 by removing the http comms check and just doing the websocket comms. It is not a solution, but a 'fix' and I will probably follow any pthon programmer that finds a more solid solution.

Probably not even a BETA! But it may help other users that also suffer from the LG update, hopefully it will guide ou to finding a permanent solution to the latest LG WebOS update.

This is a fork of the BillyNate version as LG upgraded my TV abd broke the filimonic version that I was using.
